# BSTSet
This Java Class implements a Set abstract data type using Binary Search Trees.

This class was created as a lab for my Data Structures and Algorithms Course. The idea of the class is to create an abstract data type (BSTSet) that is a set of integers. The set is implemented using a binary search tree, which makes it efficient when searching, adding, and/or deleting.
